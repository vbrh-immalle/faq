# Curriculum

## Why don’t you have your own curriculum?

If something works don't fix it. We look at curriculum very closely
and compare it to our core mission of teaching real code and tech
in ways that professionals use it. We’re also required to balance
this need with that to engage students as young as eight.
CodeCombat.com is a good example of what we see as a perfect balance
of these things. It isn’t perfect, but it is close enough to use
without having to create our own.

We actually do have a lot of our own curriculum because a lot of
educational material is either non-existent for the most recent
version of the technology we are teaching or has significant flaws in
our view making it more work to unteach what it requires students to
teach. 

## Can I use your curriculum in our school/business/home?

All our materials are released under Open Educational Resources
(OER) with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (as is included
with them all).

## What curriculum do you follow/recommend?
## Are there any curricula you discourage?

**CodeAcademy**

Yes, most of the material on codecademy.com is either buggy (the
command-line tutorial) or out of date. One example of this is
codecademy.com teaches Python 2, not Python 3, which was released
in 2008. The final 2.7 release was out in 2010. From the official
docs:

> In particular, instructors introducing Python to new programmers
> should consider teaching Python 3 first and then introducing the
> differences in Python 2 afterwards (if necessary), since Python
> 3 eliminates many quirks that can unnecessarily trip up beginning
> programmers trying to learn Python 2.

Codecademy is directly violating this request from the creators of the
language itself and has been for more than five years.

**CodeCombat.com**

Although CodeCombat.com is a major pillar of our program, using the
`loop:` construct, which they added to simplify the concept of
`while True:`, has always annoyed me. I suggest starting with the loop
the way Python really uses it and telling them what it does right
away.

**Code.org**

Great for young kids, even those that cannot type yet, but the
materials are almost entirely focused on dragging and dropping the
right blocks into place instead of typing actual code. We feel this
actually starts young students out nicely, but underestimates the
ability of kids as young at seven to begin typing actual code. Don't
baby them. They can do it.

**Scratch**

Even more focused on entertainment is Scratch. The open-ended
creativity is nice, but their is very little actual programming going
on and certainly nothing students would take with them directly into
a course or job opportunity using real programming methods from the
command line.

**Check.IO**

Amazing site, just too darn hard for most students starting out or
between 8 and 18, otherwise great!

## Why No Legos?

Several SkilStak students have competed and won at regional and
state Lego robotics competitions as members of teams outside of
SkilStak.  **SkilStak supports and encourages them and Robotics
programs everywhere. However, SkilStak will likely never offer any
Lego Robotics programs here.** Here's why.

**Lego Mindstorms is a prohibitively expensive educational toy.**

First, the Mindstorms EV3 is exorbitantly expensive. We believe that
money would be better spend by students and parents on a good
computer and/or a Raspberry Pi and actual electronics components.

Second, the Mindstorms is at best a phenomenally fun and expensive
educational toy and can never be more. We believe in focusing on
real skills that will convey directly to a college computer science
program or early career in programming. This is why we do not use
other popular educational offerings such as Python IDLE, PyGame,
Scratch, Blockly, or other educational programming languages and
frameworks in our Core Blocksâ„¢. While the code we write and projects
we make might be more fun that work, the specific workflows, tools,
and skills students learn are very real. **We don't believe in
babying students and experience has shown they don't like it either.**

**Lego Mindstorms robotics interest centers around competition.**

At one time we had six Lego Mindstorm EV3s and we pursued developing
a course in it &mdash; mostly because the EV3 can be setup to run
Linux and coded with Python. However, most of those expressing
interest in Robotics have been or want to be associated with a
competition robotics team. Besides the expense, hassle, politics,
and drama of being involved in such distracting competitions, at
SkilStak we have no interest or desire in any such competitions
because we prefer to foster internal motivation to create worth-while,
fun projects which are reward enough by themselves to remain motivated
to learn.

**Raspberry Pi is better for learning real robotics skills.**

Students who are **really** interested in robotics ultimately will
find more valuable education and enjoyment from learning the Raspberry
Pi. The Raspberry Pi is both an educational option ***and*** a very
real platform for developing all kinds of very real projects, serious
projects.  We therefore recommend our Linux on Raspberry Pi courses
to those interested in robotics where students will eventually learn
real systems administration and programming as well as actual
solid-state electronics engineering, in other words ***real***
robotics. When students attain advanced levels of proficiency in
Raspberry Pi they can incorporate servos and motors into their
constructions to make an ***actual*** robot (or anything else for
that matter) instead of a toy programmed with a toy programming
language.

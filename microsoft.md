# Microsoft

SkilStak is focused on helping others learn backend and frontend
engineering. Both of these industry domains are dominated by Mac
and Linux. Most of the web runs on Linux machines. Most of the web
is developed on Macs.

Microsoft dominates 3D at the moment but is a far inferior server
operating system s). Microsoft is changing rapidly to comply with
the standards allows Linux on their Azure cloud and shoe-horning
Bash command line into Windows 10 (for developers only). These are
things Mac and Linux have had for more than 16 years.

**Why do so many companies choose Microsoft then?**

Because they are stupid. Microsoft sales people have successfully
convinced a lot of uninformed decision makers, most of who have
never written a line of code in their lives, that Microsoft is
better for their enterprise as a whole. The lie spun by MS sales
people is that Microsoft architectures will be cheaper and easier
to implement.

**Most consumers use Microsoft Windows?**

Yep, because most consumers want a cheap computer they can use for
social media, movies, and games. Windows machines excel at games
and video hardware. Windows is probably the best system to get if
your primary use of the computer is anything to do with 3D. If you
are doing any development that does *not* involve 3D you likely
want a Mac. Mac is closing this 3D gap, but currently this makes
sense for most.

**But GameMaker only runs on Windows?**

Which is exactly why it is dying out and losing to Unity, Phaser and other
open alternatives.

**Isn't SolidWorks only Windows?**

Yes and it rocks. This is a good example of a clear case where having
a Windows operating system, (which can also run on Mac), is
a definite requirement.

# Microsoft

SkilStak is focused on helping others learn backend and frontend
engineering. Both of these industry domains are dominated by Mac
and Linux. Most of the web runs on Linux machines. Most of the web
is developed on Macs.

Microsoft dominates 3D at the moment but is a far inferior server
operating system. Microsoft is changing rapidly to comply with
the standards allowing Linux on their Azure cloud and shoe-horning
Bash command line into Windows 10 (for developers only). These are
things Mac and Linux have had for more than 16 years.

## Why do so many companies choose Microsoft then?

Because they are stupid. Microsoft sales people have successfully
convinced a lot of uninformed decision makers, most of whom have
never written a line of code in their lives, that Microsoft is
better for their enterprise as a whole. The lie spun by MS sales
people is that Microsoft architectures will be cheaper and easier
to implement.

## Most consumers use Microsoft Windows?

Yep, because most consumers want a cheap computer they can use for
social media, movies, and games. Windows machines excel at games
and video hardware. Windows is probably the best system to get if
your primary use of the computer is anything to do with 3D. If you
are doing any development that does *not* involve 3D you likely
want a Mac. Mac is closing this 3D gap, but currently this makes
sense for most.

## But GameMaker only runs on Windows?

Which is exactly why it is dying out and losing to Unity, Phaser and other
open alternatives. GameMaker has regularly crashed and corrupted
student work irrecoverably for more than five years. We'll never use
it again.

## Isn’t SolidWorks only Windows?

Yes and it rocks. This is a good example of a clear case to have
a Windows operating system, (which can also run on Mac).

## But honestly ...

Windows is an inferior operating system flawed at it’s core,
literally, and created by a mediocre company devoid of any real
innovation, a company that was formed by a guy who stole Basic and
sold it to become the giant Microsoft is. Later the greedy but
stupid company claimed the network and Google would never amount
to anything. Then they purposefully sabotaged software competing
with theirs for which they were convicted. Perhaps Microsoft’s worst
sin against humanity is Internet Explorer, which has single-handedly
held the Web back decades by being the most brain-dead,
non-standard, broken web browser in history.

It took Microsoft 15 years to realize how stupid they were to not
put Bash on the command line. During that time Macbook Pros, with
a powerful command line, grew to become an essential developer tool
(unless, of course, you are making something for Windows). Now MS is
trying to make Windows more Linux/Mac-like by putting Bash on Windows
10 some 16 years too late.

If you don't believe any of this fine, but you  still have to accept
that this screaming banshee, f-bomb dropping,  monkey boy—who
exhibits every symptom of yet another cocaine-sniffing executive—was
the CEO in charge of all major executive decisions for years:

This guy thinks acting like a crooked car salesman to peddle servers
to executives is good decision. You don't really need to know any
more about him, but there is plenty.

We are not fans of those live in mediocrity chasing and copying
those who are successful while denying them credit and screaming
like banshees that they are the best. 

Not convinced?

Well it really does not matter. Use Windows if you like. We don't
unless we absolutely have to. It is probably good you understand this
now.

# Microsoft

SkilStak is focused on helping others learn backend and frontend
engineering. Both of these industry domains are dominated by Mac
and Linux. Most of the web runs on Linux machines. Most of the web
is developed on Macs.

Microsoft dominates 3D at the moment but is a far inferior server
operating system. Microsoft is changing rapidly to comply with
the standards allowing Linux on their Azure cloud and shoe-horning
Bash command line into Windows 10 (for developers only). These are
things Mac and Linux have had for more than 16 years.

## Why do so many companies choose Microsoft then?

Because they are stupid. Microsoft sales people have successfully
convinced a lot of uninformed decision makers, most of who have
never written a line of code in their lives, that Microsoft is
better for their enterprise as a whole. The lie spun by MS sales
people is that Microsoft architectures will be cheaper and easier
to implement.

## Most consumers use Microsoft Windows?

Yep, because most consumers want a cheap computer they can use for
social media, movies, and games. Windows machines excel at games
and video hardware. Windows is probably the best system to get if
your primary use of the computer is anything to do with 3D. If you
are doing any development that does *not* involve 3D you likely
want a Mac. Mac is closing this 3D gap, but currently this makes
sense for most.

## But GameMaker only runs on Windows?

Which is exactly why it is dying out and losing to Unity, Phaser and other
open alternatives. GameMaker has regularly crashed and corrupted
student work irrecoverably for more than five years. We'll never use
it again.

## Isn't SolidWorks only Windows?

Yes and it rocks. This is a good example of a clear case where having
a Windows operating system, (which can also run on Mac), is
a definite requirement.

## But honestly ...

Windows is crap produced by a mediocre company devoid of any real
innovation that was formed by a guy who stole Basic and sold it to
become the giant Microsoft is. Later the greedy but stupid company
claimed the network and Google would never amount to anything. Then
they purposefully sabotaged software competing with theirs for which
they were convicted. But perhaps their worst sin against humanity
is Internet Explorer, which has single-handedly held the Web back
decades by being the single most brain-dead, non-standard, broken
web browser in history.

It took Microsoft 15 years to realize how stupid they were to not
put Bash on the command line, after they lost pretty much every
developer to Macbook Pros. Now they still suck at it.

If you don't believe any of this fine, but you  still have to accept
that this screaming banshee monkey boy was the CEO in charge of all
major executive decisions for years:

We are not fans of those who not only live in mediocrity, but
celebrate it chasing those who are successful, all the while denying
it and screaming like banshees that they are the best.

Better? Convinced?

If you disagree simply go away. It is probably good you understand
this is how we feel now before you get offended in class. Microsoft
sucks for everything but 3D and games. Those companies and individuals
who pick Microsoft for their server architecture are uninformed
idiots usually doing it for some reason (golf buddies with MS sales
reps) other than making the correct technical decision. And no, if
this describes you, weâ€™re not sorry.  Run off and make more stuff
no one will use unless forced. Leave the innovation to the rest of us
that actually know how to use a command line and prefer it.

Hey, you asked.
